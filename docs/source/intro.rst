Introduction
============

``bnbench`` is a Python package providing a workbench for generating, using and evaluating
Bayesian Networks.

It is produced by Ken Kitson as part of his Ph.D. work.

Motivation
**********

Manual running and evaluation of Bayesian Network Structure Learning Algorithms
provided by different tools such as Tetrad and bnlearn can be a very manually intensive
and therefore slow and cumbersome process. This workbench addresses these concerns.
