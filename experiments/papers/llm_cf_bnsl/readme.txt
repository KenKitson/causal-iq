These files were prepared for Anthony's paper comparing LLM, BNSL and expert graphs

At v133 (19/03/2024) 9 graphs (for Sports, Diarrhoea and Formed) were produced using data in 
experiments/realdata using lim_cf_bnsl.py which means they used bnlearn's 
MMHC and pc.stable and Tetrad's version of FGES, with the following EXCEPTION.

HOWEVER, bnlearn pc.stable did not complete within 1 day (we see similar problems
with synthetic data), so in that case the graph "d7a-pc.tetrad.txt" in 
"Initial submission to JBI / Report Graphs ...." generated by
the DHS paper's R code was used.

Anthony susbsequently requested the Diarrhoea graphs actually used in the paper which have been extracted
from the .RDA archives under qmul-project using the export function. These are files with _orig in names
and copies are in the gdrive Research ... DHS&BN paper folder.

Differences with the bnbench ones are:
 - MMHC, same graph just different ordering of arcs in the file
 - PC, same as before (not surprising as sourced from R code)
 - FGES, same number of edges but some are different edge
